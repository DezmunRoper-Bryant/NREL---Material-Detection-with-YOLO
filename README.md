# Material Detection using YOLOv8

YOLOv8 was used with a dataset of 5 different types of cups (Plastic Cup, Foam Cup, Paper Cup, Bottle, Metal Can) to grant the computer the ablity to determine the material of the different objects

This project has two phases:
(1) Use YOLO for material detection and (2) Integrate this model into a 2 degree of freedom robotic arm. 

The "LV Material Detection A" code can be used immediately with an external camera.
The "LV Material Detection X" code communicates with an Arduino that lets it know when the user open/closes the robotic hand.
